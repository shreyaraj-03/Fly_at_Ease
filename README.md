# Fly_at_Ease

This projects aims to make boarding process in flights fast and easy.
Through face recognition the system matches the person's face with the passports uploaded on the web app.
If the person's face matches, it allows him/her to board.

I have made this app with
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Javascript
Node Js
face-api.js
